            <p class="text__p">Hello:</p>
            <p class="text__p">
                <span class="text__p--focus">I&rsquo;m William Cabell, a senior software engineer and cybersecurity professional who finds fulfillment in solving hard, open-ended problems.</span> I&rsquo;ve led the development of multiple high-impact, large-scale enterprise cybersecurity platforms in the cryptography and cyber intelligence domains. My applications have allowed Capital One to centrally manage a library of hundreds of thousands of TLS certificates and to correlate varied data sources to curate actionable cyber intelligence that has saved the loss of millions of dollars to fraud. I use my academic background in formal mathematics and my deep curiosity for science and engineering to inform my approach to designing effective, responsible, and lasting solutions. I pride myself on teamwork across experience levels and job functions, and I continually strive for engaging communication both in personal interactions and with large groups.</p>
            <p class="text__p">
                Both in my career and beyond it, I engage wholeheartedly in everything I do. I&rsquo;ve completed over a dozen triathlons including an Ironman, I race offshore sailboats, and I&rsquo;ve coordinated multiple teams to write product roadmaps from my campsite while backcountry skiing in the Rockies. At home, I tend my meticulously designed postmodern native plant garden, invite my friends to donate me small amounts of money in the form of poker chips, and fruitlessly labor towards the end of my ever-lengthening list of books to read.</p>
            <p class="text__p">I invite you to explore my resume, peruse my blog posts on Medium, or browse through my GitHub profile. My contact information is on my resume.</p>
